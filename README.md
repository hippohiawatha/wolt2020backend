My take on the backend task

## Getting it started

- Clone it or zip it!
- In console; navigate to the project folder
- npm install to get the hottest dependencies!
- npm run watch || npm start will run the api locally.
- npm test will run the tests.

## Using the API

#### Â¡don't forget to start the thing!

- http://localhost:3003/restaurants will give you a list of all the restaurants currently in the system

- http://localhost:3003/restaurants/search?q=xxx&lat=yyy&lon=zzz will give you a list of restaurants that match given 'xxx' and are within 3km from the given coordinates 'yyy' and 'zzz'
